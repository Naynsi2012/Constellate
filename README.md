# Constellate

**Constellate** is a collaborative brainstorming canvas that helps teams turn individual ideas into shared thoughts. Participants add notes, group related ideas into clusters, vote on the most important ideas, and export the results. This helps in improving overall efficiency and quality of work and save time for group projects.

**Theme: COLLABORATION**

## Reason to choose this Theme

The main reason to select this theme was to create a collaborative platform to ensure efficient working without the distraction of online projects. I have been struggling to find a place for collaboration platform without ads and suscriptions.

## How to use Constellate

Constellate guides your team through a structured brainstorming session from generating ideas to identifying priorities.

The workflow is designed around four steps: **Lobby → Diverge → Cluster → Converge → Results/Export**.

## 1. Create/Join a Room
- Create or Join a room through room id
- Optionally, enter a question to guide the brainstorming session
- Share the room link with your teammates so they can join the same session

The room host can guide the team through the brainstorming phases.

## 2. Diverge (Generate Ideas)

In this phase, participants can contribute ideas to shared canvas.

- Create sticky notes and write your ideas on them.
- Move notes around the canvas to organize your workspace.
- Use zoom and pan to navigate the board.
- Contribute adding ideas while other participants contribute in real time.

Authors are hidden during this phase so participants can focus on ideas rather than who suggested them.

## 3. Cluster (Group related ideas)

Once everyone has contributed ideas, organize them into meaningful groups.

- Identify notes that discuss similar topics.
- Group related notes into clusters.
- Give each cluster a descriptive name.
- Use connectors to show relationships between ideas.

When zoomed out, clusters appear as summary bubbles, making larger boards easier to navigate.

## 4. Converge (Vote on ideas)

In this phase, participants vote on ideas and clusters they consider most valuable.

- Review the notes and clusters on the board.
- Use your available vote dots to support important ideas.
- Distribute your votes according to your priorities.
- Observe the voting indicators to see which ideas receive the most support.

Ideas with stronger voting support receive greater visual emphasis, helping the team identify popular suggestions and shared priorities.

## 5. Results

After the Converge phase begins, open the Results page to review the outcome of the brainstorming session.

- Review the ranked ideas and clusters.
- Identify the suggestions that received the most votes.
- Use the export option to download the results as a Markdown (.md) file.

The exported file can be saved, shared with teammates or used in meeting notes, project, documentation and future planning.

## Features

- **Shared brainstorming canvas** — create, edit, move, and style notes on a zoomable canvas.
- **Real-time collaboration** — room participants can see board updates and other participants' cursors through Socket.IO.
- **Room links and participant names** — create a room and invite others to join it.
- **Session question** — give the brainstorm a central question to guide the discussion.
- **Silent brainstorming** — authors can be hidden during Diverge so ideas can be considered on their own.
- **Clusters** — group related notes and name the themes.
- **Connectors** — draw connections between related notes, including curved arrows.
- **Phases** — organize the session into Diverge, Cluster, and Converge stages.
- **Dot-budget voting** — participants use a limited number of votes to highlight important notes and clusters.
- **Results and Markdown export** — review vote results and export the brainstorm as Markdown.
- **Canvas navigation** — pan and zoom, fit the board to the viewport, and use the minimap.
- **Room persistence** — room state can be saved as JSON files by the backend.

Folder contents may evolve as the project develops.

## How to Run Locally

### 1. Clone or download the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Naynsi2012/Constellate.git
cd Constellate
```

If you downloaded the source as a ZIP, extract it and open a terminal in the extracted project folder.

### 2. Configure the backend environment

```bash
cd Backend
npm install
cp .env.example .env
```

On Windows Command Prompt, use `copy .env.example .env` instead of `cp`.

Open `Backend/.env` and update the values if needed:

```dotenv
# Required
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=development

# Optional
DATA_DIR=./data/rooms
ROOM_TTL=3d
ROOM_CLEANUP_INTERVAL=1h
```

### 3. Start the backend

Run this from the `Backend` directory:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The backend will use the configured port, normally `http://localhost:3000`.

### 4. Configure the frontend environment

Open a second terminal from the project root:

```bash
cd Frontend
npm install
cp .env.example .env
```

On Windows Command Prompt, use `copy .env.example .env`.

The frontend `.env` should contain the backend API URL:

```dotenv
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### 5. Start the frontend

Run this from the `Frontend` directory:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Vite will print the local URL. It is usually:

```text
http://localhost:5173
```

Keep both the backend and frontend terminals running while developing.

## AI Usage

AI assistance was used during development as a support tool for implementation, debugging, and understanding parts of the codebase. In particular, AI was used to help with:

- **Curved connector and arrow bending** — working through the geometry for curved arrows, control points, arrowheads, and how connector bends are rendered on the canvas.
- **Socket.IO connections** — understanding client/server connection setup, joining rooms, event handling, broadcasting updates, and synchronizing shared room state.
- **Debugging and integration** — investigating errors, reviewing component and backend interactions, and resolving issues found while integrating canvas features with real-time room behavior.
- **Project setup** — clarifying environment configuration and how the frontend API and backend server communicate.

AI suggestions were reviewed and adapted during implementation. The project’s final behavior should be validated through local testing, particularly for multi-user synchronization and phase permissions.
